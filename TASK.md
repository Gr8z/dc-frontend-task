**Take-Home Task: E-Commerce Product Search Application**

**Objective**

Develop a multi-page web application that allows users to search for
e-commerce products and view detailed information about them. This task
is designed to showcase your proficiency in **React**, **Next.js**,
**API integration**, and **routing**.

**Requirements**

**Framework and Libraries**

- Use **Next.js App Router** (ideally version 14). Candidates with
  experience in Next.js will be prioritized.

- **Additional Libraries**: Choose any additional libraries needed for
  tasks such as styling, state management, or data fetching. Document
  your choices and reasoning in the **README**.

**API Integration**

- **Data Source**: Integrate with a free product data API to fetch
  products with names, images, prices, and basic descriptions. Example
  APIs:

  - DummyJSON Products API: <https://dummyjson.com/docs/products>

  - Fake Store API: <https://fakestoreapi.com/>

  - Platzi Fake Store API: <https://fakeapi.platzi.com/>

**Application Pages and Functionality**

**Navigation Bar (Navbar)**:

- Include a **search bar** in the navbar that is always accessible
  across all pages.

- The search bar allows users to enter product search queries at any
  time.

- Upon submitting a search, navigate to the **Product Listing Page**
  displaying the search results.

**Product Listing Page**:

- Display a list of products matching the search query.

- Show basic product information: **name**, **image**, and **price**.

- Rendering can be done dynamically; static generation is not
  required.

- **Bonus**: Implement **filtering** and/or **sorting** features.

**Product Pages**:

- For a selected subset of products (e.g., **10 products**):

- Generate **static pages** to improve load times and enhance SEO.

- Display detailed product information.

- Include an **\"Add to Cart\"** button as a mock action
  (functionality not required).

- For other products:

  - Render pages **dynamically** when accessed.

**Documentation and Submission**

**README**:

- Instructions on how to **set up and run** the application.

- Basic explanation of **architectural decisions**, **library
  choices**, and any **assumptions** made.

- Areas for **future improvement** if given more time.

**Scope Considerations**

- Focus on **core functionality**: product searching, display, static
  page generation and navigation.

- **Filtering and sorting** features are **bonus points** and **not
  required**.

- The **\"Add to Cart\"** button does not need to function.

- Exclude features like **price history** or **similar products** to
  keep the scope manageable.

**Evaluation Criteria**

- **Functionality and Completeness**: The application should be
  functional and meet the core requirements within the given
  timeframe.

- **Code Quality and Organization**: Ensure the code is
  well-structured, maintainable, and follows **React** and **Next.js**
  best practices.
